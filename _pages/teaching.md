Here's an example of something I recently taught my students how to make in a class I taught at Northwestern about data visualization. This interactive visualization show the dates, locations, and reports of Bigfoot Sightings throughout the United States from 2000-2021. These data are from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) and are available on this [tidytuesday post](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-09-13).
