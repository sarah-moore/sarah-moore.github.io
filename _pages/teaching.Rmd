Here's an example of something I recently taught my students how to make in a class I taught at Northwestern about data visualization. This interactive visualization show the dates, locations, and reports of Bigfoot Sightings throughout the United States from 2000-2021. 


```{r, out.height="100%", include = T, echo = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)

# Derived from tutorials at : http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/256588_57b585da6c054349825cba46685d8464.html
# and: https://rpubs.com/tsholliger/301914

# create a vector of just the text data 
bigfoot <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-09-13/bigfoot.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
bigfoot$new_date <- format(as.Date(bigfoot$date), "%D")

bigfoot %>%
  filter(year(date)>=2000) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  setView(-103.4617, 44.58, zoom = 4) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(~longitude, ~latitude, popup = ~paste("<b>Date:</b>", new_date, "<br>", "<b>Report</b>:", observed), 
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()) 
```
