In my dissertation, I devise a novel methodological contributions that incorporate my skills in qualitative and quantitative methods with an application to the study of comparative political economy or violent conflict.

In the first paper, *Integrative Meta-Analysis*, I propose a mixed-method, process-oriented approach to meta-analysis. I develop a procedure called *conversion elicitation*, a structured judgment process by which coders evaluate the information obtained from a qualitative study to supply information for meta-analysis via either a frequentist or Bayesian framework. I provide an applied example of this method to evaluate interventions toward reducing bureaucratic corruption based on an earlier review provided by Gans-Morse et al. (2018).  

The second paper, *Hybrid Sampling Strategies: A Design Framework for Merged Survey Designs*, develops a logic for merged probability and non-probability survey samples. I argue that context-driven decisions related to merged sampling designs can help to mitigate cost and information burdens while still retaining means to estimate uncertainty. As an extension of this paper, I also develop a survey weight estimation scheme for territorially-based hybrid samples-- wherein clustered units can "share" population information between one another to construct survey weights even if population information among them is not complete. 

The third paper, *Conceptualizing and Measuring Armed Group Presence*, develops and tests a measure of non-state armed group presence, using a Bayesian measurement model. This paper, co-authored with Ana Arjona, uses qualitative case data collected over multiple waves of fieldwork in Colombia to build the proposed measurement model. We test the model's performance across a random sample of municipalities throughout Colombia.
