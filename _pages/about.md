Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science and a Master of Science Candidate in the Department of Statistics at Northwestern University. I anticipate defending my dissertation by Spring 2024.

My dissertation project devises problem-solving methods for issues encountered in the study of comparative politics. The project is divided into three papers in preparation that each tackle a distinct methodological issue and show the method's applied utility to a research question that fits within my substantive area of expertise -- the study of the legacies of conflict and comparative political economy. I have received support for my dissertation from the Center for the Study of Security and Drugs at the Los Andes University, the Global Challenges Research Fund of the UK, the Buffett Institute for Global Studies, and the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Cluster at Northwestern University.   

I have additional substantive projects related to the legacies of armed group social orders, relational identity and post-conflict attitudes, and people's relationship to the state and other sources of authority. I primarily focus on Latin America, though I also have projects in development with applications to the United States and Ukraine. 

In my free time I am usually with my dogs or studying Brazilian jiu jitsu. 

I am on the job market! If you would like more information about anything that you see on my site, feel free to contact me by email: sarahmoore2022 [at] u.northwestern [dot] edu. Find me on Twitter [at] sarahmoreorless.
