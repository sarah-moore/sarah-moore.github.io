Welcome! I am a social science methodologist and scholar of comparative politics. I recently defended my PhD in Political Science and received my MS in Statistics from Northwestern University in July 2024. 

In my dissertation, I formalize various methodological tools for approaches to meta-analysis and improved construct validity in the social sciences. The project is divided into three papers. In each paper, I demonstrate the applied utility of the proposed methodological intervention to a research question within my substantive area of expertise -- the study of the legacies of conflict and comparative political economy. I received support for my dissertation from the Center for the Study of Security and Drugs at Los Andes University-Bogotá, the Global Challenges Research Fund of the UK, the Buffett Institute for Global Studies, and the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Cluster at Northwestern University.   

I have additional substantive projects related to the legacies of armed group social order, relational identity and post-conflict attitudes, and people's relationship to the state and other sources of authority. Most of my work focuses on Latin American politics, specifically Colombia, but I also have some projects related to American politics.
