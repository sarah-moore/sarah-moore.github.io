Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science and a Master of Science Candidate in the Department of Statistics at Northwestern University, with an anticipated defense date in late Summer 2023. My work broadly engages in the development of mixed-methods research tools in the empirical study of comparative politics. I substantively focus on the legacies of violent conflict, subnational state capacity, and rural land conflict in Latin America. 

My dissertation project devises problem-solving methods for issues encountered in the study of comparative politics. The project is divided into three papers in preparation that each tackle a distinct methodological issue and show the method's applied utility to a research question that fits within my substantive area of expertise. Support for my dissertation research has been provided by the Buffett Institute for Global Studies and the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Cluster at Northwestern, as well as the Center for the Study of Security and Drugs at the University of the Andes-Bogotá.  

<bold> More on my dissertation<\bold>: 

The first paper, <italic>Hybrid Sampling Strategies: A Design Framework for Merged Survey Designs<\italic>, develops a logic for merged probability and non-probability survey samples using knowledge about the structure of the population of interest. Depending on whether the population of interest is bound by geographical, social, or diffuse ties, scholars can leverage the structure of the population to create sampling designs that do not just attempt to merge probability and non-probability survey samples uncritically. I argue that context-driven decisions related to merged sampling designs can help to mitigate cost burden, while still retaining means to estimate uncertainty. 

In the second paper, <italic>Bayesian Integrative Meta-Analysis<\italic>, I propose a method of Bayesian meta-analysis that allows for the systematic incorporation of qualitative study information into meta-analytic summary. Specifically, I develop what I call <italic>conversion elicitation<\italic> which provides a structured judgment process by which coders evaluate the information obtained from a qualitative study to supply information into a Bayesian prior. I provide two applied examples of this method: the first related to the effect of conflict violence exposure on individual political participation; the second related to the impact of interventions on bureaucratic corruption. 

The third project component in preparation, <italic>Focus Groups and Text-as-Data: Extending the Use of Data from the Field<\italic> considers opportunities for expanding the use of the total sum of recorded fieldwork data. In an effort to maximize the use of existing field data <italic>and<\italic> reckon with the variable availability of digital data in low data legibility environments, I propose that transcribed focus group and interview data can be treated like a text corpus. In transforming these fieldwork activities into text data, many opportunities arise for scholars to engage with the entire body of information that they have collected over many hours, days, or months in the field via contemporary computational techniques. In this particular application, I will develop a means to validate the extent to which existing state capacity indices map on to the way that individuals and communities talk about state presence. 

I also have additional substantive projects related to <bold>the legacies of armed group social orders, the propagation of illicit markets in peacetime, gender and peacetime perspectives, and subnational state capacity and its measurement<\bold>, all with a regional focus in Latin America. I also have a few side projects related to media consumption and its consequences for democratic backsliding in the United States.
