Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science and a Master of Science Candidate in the Department of Statistics at Northwestern University, with an anticipated defense date in late Summer 2023. My work broadly engages in the development of quantitative and qualitative empirical research methods and comparative politics in Latin America. 

My dissertation project devises problem-solving methods for issues encountered in the study of comparative politics in places with limited information legibility. The project is divided into three papers in preparation that each tackle a distinct methodological issue and show the method's applied utility to a research question that fits within my substantive area of expertise -- the study of the legacies of conflict and comparative political economy. Support for my dissertation research has been provided by the Buffett Institute for Global Studies and the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Cluster at Northwestern, as well as the Center for the Study of Security and Drugs at the University of the Andes-Bogota.   

I have additional substantive projects related to the legacies of armed group social orders, the propagation of illicit markets in peacetime, gender and outlooks in transitions to peacetime, and subnational state capacity and its measurement, all with a regional focus in Latin America. I also have a few side projects related to media consumption and its consequences for democratic backsliding in the United States. 

I am on the job market! If you would like more information about anything that you see on my site, feel free to contact me by email: sarahmoore2022 [at] u.northwestern [dot] edu. Find me on Twitter [at] sarahmoreorless.
